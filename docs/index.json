Here, we propose a comprehensive end-to-end single-cell multimodal analysis framework named Deep Parametric Inference (DPI). DPI transforms single-cell multimodal data into a multimodal parameter space by inferring individual modal parameters. Analysis of cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) reveals that the multimodal parameter space can characterize the heterogeneity of cells more comprehensively than individual modalities. Furthermore, comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets show that DPI has superior performance. Additionally, DPI can reference and query cell types without batch effects. As a result, DPI can successfully analyze the progression of COVID-19 disease in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Notably, we further propose a cell state vector field and analyze the transformation pattern of bone marrow cells (BMC) states. In conclusion, DPI is a powerful single-cell multimodal analysis framework that can provide new biological insights into biomedical researchers.","tags":[null],"title":"Modeling and analyzing single-cell multimodal data with deep parametric inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingxuan Zhao","Jianqiang Sun","Stella C.

Recent vision transformers have shown promising performance in handling the variation through global con text modeling. Still, they have not thoroughly solved the problem of ambiguous boundaries as they ignore the com plementary usage of the boundary knowledge and global contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-scale boundary-aware transformer, XBound-Former, to simulta neously address the variation and boundary problems of skin lesion segmentation. XBound-Former is a purely attention-based network and catches boundary knowledge via three specially designed learners.

Second, we propose an ex plicit boundary learner (ex-Bound) to extract the boundary knowledge at multiple scales and convert it into embed dings explicitly. Third, based on the learned multi-scale boundary embeddings, we propose a cross-scale bound ary learner (X-Bound) to simultaneously address the prob lem of ambiguous and multi-scale boundaries by using learned boundary embedding from one scale to guide the boundary-aware attention on the other scales.

Unlike simple radiation damage to other organs, radiation proctitis is a complex disease closely related to the microbiota. However, analysis of the gut microbiota is time-consuming and expensive. This study aims to mine rectal information using radiomics and incorporate it into a nomogram model for cheap and fast prediction of severe radiation proctitis prediction in postoperative cervical cancer patients. **Methods:** The severity of the patient’s radiation proctitis was graded according to the RTOG/EORTC criteria. The toxicity grade of radiation proctitis over or equal to grade 2 was set as the model’s target. A total of 178 patients with cervical cancer were divided into a training set (n = 124) and a validation set (n = 54). Multivariate logistic regression was used to build the radiomic and non-raidomic models. **Results:** The radiomics model [AUC=0.6855(0.5174-0.8535)] showed better performance and more net benefit in the validation set than the non radiomic model [AUC=0.6641(0.4904-0.8378)]. In particular, we applied SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method for the first time to a radiomics based logistic regression model to further interpret the radiomic features from case-based and feature-based perspectives. The integrated radiomic model enables the first accurate quantitative assessment of the probability of radiation proctitis in postoperative cervical cancer patients, addressing the limitations of the current qualitative assessment of the plan through dose volume parameters only.","tags":[null],"title":"Development and validation of an interpretable radiomic nomogram for severe radiation proctitis prediction in postoperative cervical cancer patients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["袁钦湄","杨峘","张骏","刘博雯","帅建伟","曹玉萍"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"2aaca0c4025ea17ce0a5014956b61f82","permalink":"https://lh00830.github.io/academic-group.github.io/publication/2023emotional/","publishdate":"2023-01-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic-group.github.io/publication/2023emotional/","section":"publication","summary":"探索基于深度学习算法的抑郁症患者表情动作变化与其症状转归及内在心理整合的关系。**方法:** 采集1例抑郁症患者14次认知行为治疗的全程音视频资料，使用汉密尔顿抑郁量表（HAMD）与汉密尔顿焦虑量表 （HAMA）评估病情，采用深度学习算法分析患者的表情熵、表情成分和动作幅度，采用整合分析方法评估患者的问 题体验整合顺序（APES）。 **结果:** 治疗前后患者HAMD与HAMA减分率分别为90.91%和91.43%。随治疗进行，患者 表情熵值呈现波动式上升，抑郁表情出现的概率总体呈降低趋势，整体动作幅度逐渐增高，语量逐渐增加。患者最 初APES评分0分，治疗结束时APES评分为7分。结论：基于深度学习算法的抑郁症外显的表情与动作变化，与其 内在的心理整合变化呈现一致性。将深度学习算法应用于抑郁症患者的表情识别和姿势评估是可行的。","tags":[null],"title":"基于深度学习算法的抑郁症表情与动作及其心理整合变化的过程分析","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jing Qu","Chunlei Shao","Yongfa Ying","Yuning Wu","Wen Liu","Yuhua Tian","Zhiyong Yin","Xiang Li","Zhengquan Yu","Jianwei Shuai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1670284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670284800,"objectID":"52fdef6e73e11dff3f29b3a99440dc44","permalink":"https://lh00830.github.io/academic-group.github.io/publication/2022-jing-qu/","publishdate":"2023-01-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic-group.github.io/publication/2022-jing-qu/","section":"publication","summary":"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic inflammatory disorders caused by the disruption of immune tolerance to the gut microbiota. MicroRNA-31 (MIR31) has been proven to be up-regulated in intestinal tissues from patients with IBDs and colitis-associated neoplasias. While the functional role of MIR31 in colitis and related diseases remain elusive. Combining mathematical modeling and experimental analysis, we systematically explored the regulatory mechanism of MIR31 in inflammatory and epithelial regeneration responses in colitis. Level of MIR31 presents an “adaptation” behavior in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and the similar behavior is also observed for the key cytokines of p65 and STAT3. Simulation analysis predicts MIR31 suppresses the activation of p65 and STAT3 but accelerates the recovery of epithelia in colitis, which are validated by our experimental observations. Further analysis reveals that the number of proliferative epithelial cells, which characterizes the inflammatory process and the recovery of epithelia in colitis, is mainly determined by the inhibition of MIR31 on IL17RA. MIR31 promotes epithelial regeneration in low levels of DSS-induced colitis but inhibits inflammation with high DSS levels, which is dominated by the competition for MIR31 to either inhibit inflammation or promote epithelial regeneration by binding to different targets. The binding probability determines the functional transformation of MIR31, but the functional strength is determined by MIR31 levels. Thus, the role of MIR31 in the inflammatory response can be described as the “spring like effect,” where DSS, MIR31 action strength, and proliferative epithelial cell number are regarded as external force, intrinsic spring force, and spring length, respectively. Overall, our study uncovers the vital roles of MIR31 in balancing inflammation and the recovery of epithelia in colitis, providing potential clues for the development of therapeutic targets in drug design.","tags":[null],"title":"The spring-like effect of microRNA-31 in balancing inflammatory and regenerative responses in colitis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dongdong Liu","Bowen Liu","Tao Lin","Guangya Liu","Guoyu Yang","Dezhen Qi","Ye Qiu","Yuer Lu","Qinmei Yuan","Stella C.

In clinical practice, the evaluation approaches are mainly based on psychological scales and doctor-patient interviews, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Also, the accuracy of results mainly depends on the subjective judgment of the clinician. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, more and more machine learning methods are used to diagnose depression by appearance characteristics. Most of the previous research focused on the study of single-modal data; however, in recent years, many studies have shown that multi-modal data has better prediction performance than single-modal data. This study aimed to develop a measurement of depression severity from expression and action features and to assess its validity among the patients with MDD. **Methods：** We proposed a multi-modal deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to evaluate the severity of depressive symptoms in real-time, which was based on the detection of patients’ facial expression and body movement from videos captured by ordinary cameras. We established behavioral depression degree (BDD) metrics, which combines expression entropy and action entropy to measure the depression severity of MDD patients.**Results：** We found that the information extracted from different modes, when integrated in appropriate proportions, can significantly improve the accuracy of the evaluation, which has not been reported in previous studies. This method presented an over 74% Pearson similarity between BDD and selfrating depression scale (SDS), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS),depression scale (HAMD). In addition, we tracked and evaluated the changes of BDD in patients at different stages of a course of treatment and the results obtained were in agreement with the evaluation from the scales. **Discussion:** The BDD can effectively measure the current state of patients’depression and its changing trend according to the patient’s expression and action features.

Numerous research studies have proven that although lncRNAs cannot be directly translated into proteins, lncRNAs still play an important role in human growth processes by interacting with proteins. Since traditional biological experiments often require a lot of time and material costs to explore potential lncRNA–protein interactions (LPI), several computational models have been proposed for this task. In this study, we introduce a novel deep learning method known as combined graph auto-encoders (LPICGAE) to predict potential human LPIs. First, we apply a variational graph auto-encoder to learn the low dimensional representations from the high-dimensional features of lncRNAs and proteins. Then the graph auto-encoder is used to reconstruct the adjacency matrix for inferring potential interactions between lncRNAs and proteins. Finally, we minimize the loss of the two processes alternately to gain the final predicted interaction matrix. The result in 5-fold cross-validation experiments illustrates that our method achieves an average area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.974 and an average accuracy of 0.985, which is better than those of existing six state-of-the-art computational methods.

Previous models for these intriguing natural optical phenomena suggested the combined action of two populations of guanine crystals with an orthogonal low-refractive-index optic axis.

We examined the three-dimensional structure of the guanine assembly in the spider and performed finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) optical modeling of the guanine-based multilayer reflector. Comparative modeling studies reveal that the biological selection of the guanine crystal type and specific spatial arrangement work synergistically to optimize the polarization-insensitive broadband reflection. This study demonstrates the importance of both crystallographic characteristics and 3D arrangement of guanine crystals in understanding relevant natural optical effects and also provides new insights into similar broadband, low-polarizing reflections in biological optical systems.

Combining mathematical modeling with experimental analysis of NLRP1b inflammasome signaling, we found that only the expression levels of caspase-1 and GSDMD have the potential to individually switch cell death modes. Reduction of caspase-1 or GSDMD switches cell death from pyroptosis to apoptosis. Caspase-1 and GSDMD present different thresholds and exert distinct pathway choices in switching death modes. Pyroptosis switches to apoptosis with an extremely low threshold level of caspase-1, but with a high threshold of GSDMD. Caspase-1-impaired cells employ ASC-caspase-8-dependent pathway for apoptosis, while GSDMD-impaired cells primarily utilize caspase-1-dependent pathway. Additionally, caspase-1 and GSDMD can severally ignite the cooccurrence of pyroptosis and apoptosis. Landscape topography unravels that the cooccurrence is dramatically different in caspase-1- and GSDMD-impaired cells. Besides pyroptosis state and apoptosis state, a potential new \"coexisting\" state in single cells is proposed when GSDMD acts as the driving force of the landscape. The \"seesaw model\" is therefore proposed, which can well describe the death states that are controlled by caspase-1 or GSDMD in single cells. Our study sheds new light on NLRP1b inflammasome signaling and uncovers the switching mechanisms among various death modes, providing potential clues to guide the development of more rational control strategies for diseases.","tags":[null],"title":"Caspase-1 and Gasdermin D Afford the Optimal Targets with Distinct Switching Strategies in NLRP1b Inflammasome-Induced Cell Death","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huan Hu","Ruiqi Liu","Chunlin Zhao","Yuer Lu","Yichun Xiong","Lingling Chen","Jun Jin","Yunlong Ma","Jianzhong Su","Zhengquan Yu","Feng Cheng","Fangfu Ye","Liyu Liu","Qi Zhao","Jianwei Shuai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1657843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657843200,"objectID":"331ce30c10b702bc4c10f7c68c1e3141","permalink":"https://lh00830.github.io/academic-group.github.io/publication/2022rnab/","publishdate":"2023-01-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic-group.github.io/publication/2022rnab/","section":"publication","summary":"Simultaneous measurement of multiple modalities in single-cell analysis, represented by CITE-seq, is a promising approach to link transcriptional changes to cellular phenotype and function, requiring new computational methods to define cellular subtypes and states based on multiple data types.

To further validate the robustness of the CITEMO framework, we analyse Human Bone Marrow Cell (HBMC) samples and identify different states of the same cell type.

Here we developed an algorithm with a Graphic User Interface named MSSort-DIAXMBD, which combines the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and the double-threshold segmentation process, to automatically recognize the high confidence precursors and low confidence precursors. To train the model of MSSort-DIAXMBD, we built a database contained about 50,000 manually classified peptide precursors acquired from different instrument platforms and different species.

Most recently, mounting evidence accumulates that pyroptotic signaling is highly correlated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thus, understanding the induction of the pyroptotic signaling and dissecting the detail molecular control mechanisms are urgently needed. Based on recent experimental studies, a core reg ulatory model of the pyroptotic signaling is constructed to investigate the intricate crosstalk dynamics between the two cell death types, i.e., pyroptosis and secondary pyroptosis. The model well reproduces the experimental observations under different conditions. Sensitivity analysis determines that only the expression level of caspase-1 or GSDMD has the potential to individually change death modes. The de crease of caspase-1 or GSDMD level switches cell death from pyroptosis to secondary pyroptosis. Be sides, eight biochemical reactions are identified that can efficiently switch death modes. While from the viewpoint of bifurcation analysis, the expression level of caspase-3 is further identified and twelve bio chemical reactions are obtained. The coexistence of pyroptosis and secondary pyroptosis is predicted to be observed not only within the bistable range, but also within proper monostable range, presenting two potential different control mechanisms. Combined with the landscape theory, we further explore the stochastic dynamic and global stability of the pyroptotic system, accurately quantifying how each compo nent mediates the individual occurrence probability of pyroptosis and secondary pyroptosis. Overall, this study sheds new light on the intricate crosstalk of the pyroptotic signaling and uncovers the regulatory mechanisms of various stable state transitions, providing potential clues to guide the development for prevention and treatment of pyroptosis-related diseases","tags":[null],"title":"Network modeling-based identification of the switching targets between pyroptosis and secondary pyroptosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nelson Bighetti"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554595200,"objectID":"557dc08fd4b672a0c08e0a8cf0c9ff7d","permalink":"https://lh00830.github.io/academic-group.github.io/publication/preprint/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic-group.github.io/publication/preprint/","section":"publication","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
